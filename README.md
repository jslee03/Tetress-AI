**This is an assignment from The University of Melbourne**  
School of Computing and Information Systems  
COMP30024 Artificial Intelligence  
*Project Part B, Semester 1, 2024*

By Jess Lee and William Theofanous

**Objective**\
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Develop an AI agent capable of playing the full two-player version of Tetress.
- Apply game-playing techniques such as adversarial search algorithms.

**Features**
- Adversarial Search: Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize decision-making in competitive gameplay.
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Uses probabilistic methods to explore potential game outcomes and select the best moves.
- Strategic Gameplay: The agent evaluates game states to choose optimal actions based on the evolving game environment.
